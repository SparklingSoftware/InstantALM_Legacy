===== Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) =====

The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide is a book that provides standard terminology and guidelines for project management. The PMBOK Guide is process-based, and as such it describes a work as being accomplished by the processes. This process-based approach is consistent with the other management standards such as ISO 9000 and CMMI//[[:general:glossary|glossary]]// (standard of Software Engineering Institute). According to this approach, the processes overlap and interact throughout a project or the various phases of a project. The PMBOK Guide is intended to provide a general guide for managing most of the projects most of the time. At present, there are two extensions of the PMBOK Guide: the Construction Extension of the PMBOK Guide applies to construction projects, while the Government Extension to the PMBOK Guide applies to government projects.

The PMBOK guide was first published by the Project Management Institute (PMI)((http://www.pmi.org/en.aspx)) in the form of a white paper in 1983 so as to document and standardize the generally accepted project management information and practices. The first edition of PMBOK was published in 1996 and it was followed by the second edition in 2000. In 2004, the third edition of PMBOK guide was published with some major changes. The latest Fourth Edition of PMBOK was released on December 31, 2008. American National Standards Institute (ANSI)//[[:general:glossary|glossary]]// recognized the Fourth Edition of PMBOK (2008) as the ANSI/PMI 99-001-2008 standard. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers has also recognized PMBOK (2008) as IEEE 1490-2011//[[:general:glossary|glossary]]//. At present, the work on the fifth edition of PMBOK is underway and the edition is expected to be released in 2012/2013. 
The Processes of PMBOK have been described in terms of their Inputs (consisting of documents, plans, designs, etc.); Tools and Techniques (mechanisms applied to inputs); and Outputs (consisting of documents, products, etc.). PMBOK recognizes 42 processes that can be divided into five basic process groups and nine knowledge areas that are typical of almost all projects. The five process groups in PMBOK are: 
1.	Initiating  processes – recognizing the beginning of project or phases
2.	Planning processes – preparing and maintaining a workable scheme to accomplish the business needs that a project wishes to undertake
3.	Executing processes – coordinating the people and the other resources for executing a business plan
4.	Controlling processes – ensuring that the project objectives are met by monitoring and measuring the progress of the processes
5.	Closing processes – acceptance of the project or the phases and bringing them to an end
The five process groups and interlinks among them are given below:

==== PMBOK Knowledge Areas ====

The nine Knowledge Areas of PMBOK are: 
1.	Project Integration Management
2.	Project Scope Management
3.	Project Time Management
4.	Project Cost Management
5.	Project Quality Management
6.	Project Human Resource Management
7.	Project Communications Management
8.	Project Risk Management
9.	Project Procurement Management
Each of the nine knowledge areas comprises of the processes that are required to be completed within its discipline for an effective project management program. The five basic process groups also create a matrix structure in such a way that every process can be related to one specific knowledge area and one process group. 

=== Project Integration Management ===
It is a subset of project management that includes the processes that are needed for the proper coordination of the project. Project Integration Management comprises of: Project Plan Development (including the results of the other planning processes and integrating them in a consistent and coherent document); Project Plan Execution; and Overall Change Control (coordinating the changes across the project).

=== Project Scope Management ===
It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed to complete a project successfully by including the work required. It comprises of: Initiation; Scope Planning; Scope Definition; Scope Verification; and Scope Change Control. 

=== Project Time Management ===
It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed for the timely completion of a project. It comprises of: Activity Definition; Activity Sequencing; Activity Duration Estimating; Schedule Development; and Schedule Control.

=== Project Cost Management ===
It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed to ensure that a project is completed within the limits of the approved budget. It comprises of: Resource Planning; Cost Estimating; Cost Budgeting; and Cost Control. 

=== Project Quality Management ===
It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed to ensure that the project meets the quality standards. It comprises of: Quality Planning; Quality Assurance; and Quality Control. 

=== Project Human Resource Management ===

It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed to make the most effective utilization of the manpower involved in the project. It comprises of: Organizational Planning; Staff Acquisition; and Team Development. 

=== Project Communications Management ===

It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed to ensure that there is timely and effective generation, collection, dissemination, storage and disposition of project information and communication. It comprises of: Communications Planning; Information Distribution; Performance Reporting; and Administrative Closure.

=== Project Risk Management ===

It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed for the proper identification, analysis, and response to project risks. It comprises of: Risk Identification; Risk Quantification; Risk Response Development; and Risk Response Control. 

=== Project Procurement Management ===

It is a subset of project management and it includes the processes that are needed for acquiring the goods and services from outside the organization. It comprises of: Procurement Planning; Solicitation Planning; Solicitation; Source Selection; Contract Administration; and Contract Close-out//[[:general:glossary|glossary]]//.

==== Comparing PMBOK with PrinceII ====

//[[:frameworks:princeii|PRINCE2]]//
PMBOK is a knowledge-based approach that covers the vast subject of project management. On the other hand, PRINCE 2 is a process-based approach to project management that lays down a process model (of eight processes) intended to be used steps in a logical sequence by a project manager while planning and managing a project. The application of the process model can be done in most types of projects with a wide range of complexity. The PMBOK describes a set of processes that are grouped under nine Knowledge Areas that can be also linked in five groups by the project manager. The key difference between the PMBOK and PRINCE 2 is that the PMBOK provides the project manager with a considerable repository of information about proven practises in this field and facilitates the project manager to apply these where they deem appropriate whereas PRINCE2 offers a more prescriptive set of steps for the project manager and his teams to follow.
