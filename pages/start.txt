====== About the ALM Library ======

The "Application Lifecyle Management Library" contains Job-aids, standards and practices agreed by the ALM-Community [(www.alm-community.org)]

  * The content is 100% community driven and only contains content that your peers consider useful. The rest simply doesn't make it in.
  * Installing an on-premise instance of this library provides the end user with regular updates of improvements which can be chosen to be adopted or ignored.
  * This initiative is focused on prevention of re-invention of wheels by:
    * Investigating and keeping conversation history
    * Disclosing all the information that led to the decision.
    See [[:contribute|Contribute]] for more information.)
