===== Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) =====


Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) can be defined as a framework that provides the set policies for organizing the IT infrastructure, development and organization of the IT service providers. The 'ITIL framework' is used to organize the system and network management departments within an individual organization. It was originally created by the Office of Government Commerce((http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/)), a department in the government of the United Kingdom((http://itsm.fwtk.org/index.htm)). ITIL is a set of practices for Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) //[[:general:glossary]]// that is aimed at aligning the IT services with business requirements. ITIL is based on the best-practices of the Information Technology industry. Information Technology Infrastructure Library is a set of best-practice lifecycle recommendations having common definitions and terminology. 

==== ITIL v3 (2011 edition) ====
In the present form (2011 edition), Information Technology Infrastructure Library has been laid out in a series of five core publications or volumes each covering a specific lifecycle stage in Information Technology Service Management (ITSM). The volumes of ITIL lay out the 'disciplines', covering individual subjects and approaches. Conceptually, the driving volume for ITIL is the 'Service Strategy', which offers a view of the framework that aligns business with IT so that each can complement each other in the best possible manner. The remaining four volumes of the set are ‘Service Design’, ‘Service Transition’, ‘Service Operation’ and ‘Continual Service Improvement’. The service lifecycle and their ‘volumes’ have been described below:

__Service Strategy:__ The ITIL Service Strategy (SS) volume is aimed at clarifying and prioritizing service-provider investments in services and as such the volume is at the core of ITIL Service Lifecycle. The Service Strategy focuses on guiding the IT service providers to enhance and develop their processes in order to maximize the benefits that their customers derive from their services. Service Strategy is driven largely by the market dynamics of IT services with a clear understanding of the needs of the customers and the marketplace. 
ITIL Service Strategy covers the following processes:
1.	Strategy Management for IT services
2.	Demand Management
3.	Service Portfolio Management
4.	Financial Management of IT Services //[[:general:glossary]]//
5.	Business Relationship Management //[[:general:glossary]]//

__Service Design:__ The ITIL Service Design (SD) volume contains the good-practice guidance for the design of IT services, processes, and other areas of the service management effort. Service Design within ITIL includes all the elements pertinent to technology service delivery, rather than solely focusing on the design of technology itself. The service design volume is used to formulate how a planned service solution interacts with the overall business and technical environments, processes which interact with the service, service management systems required to support the service, technology and architecture that are required to support the service, and the supply chain that is required to support the planned service. The design work for an IT service in ITIL is aggregated into a single service design package (SDP) and the SDPs along with other information about services are managed within the service catalogues //[[:general:glossary]]//. The processes that are covered within Service Design are:
1.	Service level Management – It provides for the continual identification, monitoring and review of IT services levels as specified in the Service-level agreements (SLAs). It is the main interface with the customers (in contrast with the practice of users serviced by the service desk). The Service Level Management is responsible for the following tasks: ensuring that the IT services are delivered properly; integrating availability management, capacity management, incident management and problem management so as to ensure that the required levels and quality of service are within the resources agreed with financial management; documenting and maintaining a service catalogue ; ensuring that a proper IT service continuity plan exists to support business continuity 
2.	IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM) – It includes the processes by which plans are made to ensure that the IT Services can recover and continue even after a serious incident. ITSCM is intended to adopt proactive measures, thereby reducing the risk of potential disasters in the first instance
3.	Availability Management – It helps the organisations to sustain their IT service-availability and support the business at a justifiable cost. Availability management enhances the ability of an IT component to perform optimally at desired level over a period of time
4.	Information Security Management System //[[:general:glossary]]//
5.	Design coordination 
6.	Service Catalogue
7.	Capacity Management – It is used to support optimum and cost-effective provision of IT services by enabling organisations align their IT resources with business demands
8.	Supplier Management

__Service Transition:__ ITIL Service Transition volume describes the delivery of services that are required by a business engaged in live or operational use. Service Transition often deals with the project side of Information Technology rather than ‘Business As Usual (BAU)’. The function of Service Transition is to provide services that are needed by the business for operational use. It delivers this by getting the Service Design Package from the Service Design stage and providing that to the Operational stage for ongoing operation and support of that service. Service Transition focuses on deploying every aspect of the service, and not just the application and its use in normal circumstances. Service Transition is needed to ensure that the service can operate in all unforeseen abnormal circumstances, and that the support for failure or errors is available readily. The key principles of Service Transition that facilitate effective use of new or changed services are:
1.	Understanding all the services, and their utility and warranties 
2.	Establishing a formal policy and common framework to implement all required changes, with consistency and comprehensiveness and to ensure that no services, stakeholders, occasions etc. are missed out to cause service failures
3.	Supporting the transfer of knowledge, decision support and re-use of processes, systems and other elements with effective Service Transition delivered by involving all parties
4.	Managing ‘course corrections’ for being proactive and determining likely course correction
5.	Managing Service Transition and Service Transition requirements effectively throughout the service lifecycle

__Service Operation:__ 
The Service Operation (SO) volume of ITIL aims at providing the best practice for achieving the delivery of agreed levels of services for both the end-users and the customers. Service Operation is the part of the lifecycle where there is the delivery of services and value generated. In this volume the monitoring of problems and balance between service reliability and cost are also considered. The functions of Service Operation include technical management, operations management, application management and service desk along with the responsibilities for the personnel engaged in Service Operation.
The processes that are involved in Service Operation are:
1.	Event management
2.	Request fulfilment
3.	Problem management
4.	Incident management
5.	Access management

__Continual Service Improvement (CSI):__ 
Continual Service Improvement (CSI) focuses on maintaining value for customers by the continual evaluation and improvement of quality of services and the overall maturity of the ITSM service lifecycle and its processes. It combines the principles, practices and methods involved in quality management, Change Management and capability improvement, thereby working to enhance each stage in the service lifecycle, along with the current services, processes, and other activities and technology. The focus of CSI is the improvement of business perspectives of service quality. CSI aims at improving the process effectiveness, efficiency and cost effectiveness of the IT processes throughout the service lifecycle.

==== Benefits of ITIL: ==== 
ITIL can be used by the organizations for attaining the minimum level of competency as it gives a clear description of the processes, tasks and the checklists that are specific to any organization. ITIL helps in achieving a much more joined up and end-to-end approach to IT service management thus replacing the ‘technology silos’ and isolated ‘islands of excellence’. 
ITIL provides a framework for the governance of Information Technology, as the ‘service wrap’. The framework can be used to measure and demonstrate compliance within an organization and to also measure process improvements. It focuses on the continual measurement and improvement of the quality of IT service delivered, with both business and customer perspectives. This focus is a key factor in the worldwide success of ITIL and its prolific usage. ITIL also provides some crucial benefits to the organizations that have deployed its techniques and processes. Some of these benefits are:

==== Overlap of ITIL and BABOK ==== 
//[[:frameworks:ba_bok|Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK)]]//
Service Strategy, Service Design and Continual Service Improvement (CSI) are engaged in the thorough understanding of the business requirements in order to meet the business requirements. In particular, Service Design covers many areas of business analysis thoroughly, (such as interviewing and prototyping). Service Design also has a very good Requirements Template. ITIL refers to Requirements Analysis as ‘Requirements Engineering’ and as such it offers a lot of material that can be of great value for the business analysts. BABOK can also benefit greatly from the ‘Service’ and ‘Process’ descriptions and guidelines of ITIL. 
BABOK lays down the guidelines for transition requirements and the process of defining, and deploying these can be much clearer by use of the Service Transition book that would also help by more clearly defining the interface to Change Management. Experienced Business Analysts who use BABOK as a reference have very specific skills that can complement the Service Management engagement. Their experience and training can help them to elicit the well formed requirements and then define and communicate them clearly and precisely. BABOK also provides more considered and up-to-date material from the field of business analysis, than the guide in Service Design. BABOK also provides a good conceptual framework to gather and manage the requirements and it can be very effective with the complementary integration of BABOK and ITIL. 
Some of the specific links that can be found between the processes of BABOK and ITIL are:
1.	CSI with Elicitation – The CSI of ITIL uses an understanding of the Business Vision and Goals as a starting point, just as the Elicitation Process of BABOK uses Enterprise Analysis as the starting point. Both of them acknowledge the fact that the requirements for improvement can only make sense within the Business Context and they have to go through a multiple stage refinement process to prioritise those that can deliver the highest value to cost ratio
2.	Service Strategy with Enterprise Analysis & Elicitation – The Enterprise Analysis & Elicitation of BABOK as well as the Service Strategy of ITIL explores the Market Spaces and Business Opportunities and maps them to the existing product and service solutions
3.	Service Design with “Enterprise Analysis + Requirements Analysis + Solution Assessment & Validation” – The largest area for the overlap of ITIL with BABOK is at Service Design. The Service Design Package (SDP) is the central part of the Service Portfolio of ITIL that relates to Business Analysis 
4.	Service Transition with Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring – The requirement of business analysis is covered quite well in the Service Transition volume of ITIL. The V- Diagram and its components of Service Transition can be improved by recognising the role of Business Analysis in Planning and Monitoring as well as in the Enterprise Analysis and Requirements Analysis processes
